# AI-Crypto-Jupyter-Notebook

This project looks to analyze tow crytpocurrencies (BTC and ETH) using Random Forest factor analysis. Recurring Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory algorithms to predict future prices and future profits for BTC and ETH. All analysis is done using a Jupyter Notebook and the data is from Kaggle.

The first section of the project displays visualization and how I observed the data we retrieved. I believe it is important to always observe the data before analysis to understand what I am dealing with.

The second section of the project looks to use Random Forrest and Principal Factor Analysis to determine what patterns arise/ to look for when trying to predict if cryptocurrencies are going to turn a profit the next day.

The next section in this project is testing the accuracy of our binary factors using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC). I visualized the graphs and created a heat map that corresponds to the confusion correlation matrix, another test for the accuracy of our algorithm. For all accuracy measures above I used in and out of sample testing, i.e., train and test data.

The next section of the project displays the decision tree used in our random forest analysis and displayed the accuracy measures of my analysis against the baseline of 50%.

The next two sections display the Recurring Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory forecast. The data for these forecasts use the daily close price recorded for BTC.
